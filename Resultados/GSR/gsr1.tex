\subsubsection{Galvanic skin reaction and temperature data;}
\label{subsubsec:results_gsr_temp_1}

The GSR analysis is based in the average level of the signal during each run of the experiment and its comparison to the participant baseline, collected before each round. For the experiment, the GSR sensor was worn on the left hand for right-handed participant and on the right hand for left-handed participants. One of the blind participants had the GSR sensor removed during the experiment because it was not appropriately fixed.

Table \ref{tab:gsr_table_blind} presents the GSR mean values for each of the three remaining participants. For all the participants, the baseline was smaller than the values obtained during the experiment, as expected. Moreover, in most of the cases, the skin conductance has risen from the ‘first’ to the ‘return’, indicating an increase in the mental workload.

Table \ref{tab:gsr_var_blind} brings the percentual increase in the GSR mean when compared to the baseline value. Figure \ref{fig:barplot_gsr_avg_5_scene_blind} shows the corresponding barplot. Apparently, the presence of a haptic device causes an increase in the skin conductance, hence its mental workload. Also, it is possible to observe the increase in GSR mean between the two rounds, excepted for the haptic belt.

Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_gsr_avg_blind_scene} presents the boxplot of the percentual variation in the skin conductance for each method. The ‘base’ method has the lowest variation among all methods. Also, the introduction of vibration increases the method variance. Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_gsr_avg_blind_rounds} presents the GSR grouped by the rounds. In this case there is no apparent different between the rounds.

Figures \ref{fig:qqplot_gsr_two_way_blind} and \ref{fig:residplot_gsr_two_way_blind} shows the QQ plot and the residual distribution. The Table \ref{tab:blocanova_gsr_two_way_blind} shows the ANOVA test p-value for the GSR percentual variance. Although the p-value for the method is not below the threshold of 0.05, it close to it, indicating that probably the GSR is affected by it. 

The Figures  shows the distribution and variance of the Table \ref{tab:gsr_var_blind}. These Figures shows that the data are normally distributed but the participants had different  that the methods have a similar variance.

%The Table \ref{tab:blocanova_gsr_two_way_blind} does not prove that any method or round has some influence in the skin conductance variation, thus in the Mental Workload. Although, in the Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_gsr_avg_blind_scene} it is posible to notice that the "Base" and the "Audio" method have a different distribution. As it has already commented before, maybe the result of the anova test is a conseguence of a small sample size.
