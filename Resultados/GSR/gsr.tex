\label{subsec:results_gsr_temp}

The GSR analysis is made by analysing the average in each round and comparing with the "Baseline" average. The temperature was analysed with the GSR to see if there is some influence and by a graphical analysis there was none.

The Table \ref{tab:gsr_table} presents the average skin conductance by each participant on each scenes and they are plotted in the Figures \ref{fig:barplot_gsr_scene_blind} and \ref{fig:barplot_gsr_scene_sight}. It is possible to see that in all of the methods there was an increase of the average skin conductace, meaning that the user was aroused and maybe an increase of the mental workload.

The Table \ref{tab:gsr_variation} show the the variation of the heart beat in each the rounds of each participant. It is also possible to notice the same increase noticed before.

% and the Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_md_scene} these data is plotted. The figure shows a noticible difference between the two groups.  The Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_md_scene} indicates a visual difference between the mental demmand feeled by the sighted participants and the mental demand feeled by the blind participants. Inside the blind participants groups is also noticible a difference between the methods, but the ones that are different does not show a better performance, instead a higher mental demand than the one feeled during the "Base" method.

The Shapiroâ€“Wilk normality test on the Table \ref{tab:shapiro_gsr} shows that only the "Audio" method is normally distributed for the "blind" sample while for the "sight" sample only the "Virtual Cane" is not normally distributed

\input{Resultados/GSR/Tabelas/shapiro_gsr}

Acording to the T-Test presented on the Table \ref{tab:ttest_gsr} there are no difference on the heart rate frequency variation between the sample groups.

\input{Resultados/GSR/Tabelas/ttest_gsr}

The Table \ref{tab:anova_gsr} shows the Anova test p-value of the heart rate frequency of the "blind" sample between the guidance methods presented on the Table \ref{tab:gsr_variation}. The p-value indicates that there is at least one method that is statistically equal to one of the other methods.

\input{Resultados/GSR/Tabelas/anova_gsr.tex}

The Table \ref{tab:lsd_gsr} presents the conclusion of a pairwise Fisher LSD test of the blind heart rate frequency variation between all the guidance methods. The results show that the "Virtual Cane" and the "Mixture" have different variation, but since they are not normally distributed this conclusion can not statistically be made.

\input{Resultados/GSR/Tabelas/lsd_gsr.tex}

%The Table \ref{tab:anova_mental_demand_var} shows the Anova test p-value of the mental demand variation of the "blind" sample between the guidance methods presented on the Table \ref{tab:md_variation}. The p-value indicates that there is at least one method that is statistically equal to one of the other methods so its recommended to do a pairwise analyses between all the methods.

%
%The Table \ref{tab:lsd_mental_demand_var} presents the conclusion of a pairwise Fisher LSD test of the blind mental demand variation between all the guidance methods. The results show that the "Virtual Cane" method has a similar mental demand variation with the "Base" method. All other methods have a different variation. This can be seen at the Table \ref{tab:md_var_average_group} and in the Figure \ref{fig:barplot_md_var_scene_blind} compiles the mental demand average of the methods observed on all of the participants.

%According to T-Test on Table \ref{tab:ttest_mental_demand}, the mental demand of the "sight" sample is similar to the "blind" sample, excluding only on the "Audio" method.
%
%According to both Anova test at Table \ref{tab:anova_mental_demand_avg} and \ref{tab:anova_mental_demand_var}, Tables \ref{tab:md_average} and \ref{tab:md_variation} and Figure \ref{fig:barplot_md_var_scene_blind}, none of the methods did provoke a higher mental demand variation than the one notice on the "Base" method on the participants and the only different mental demand average was noticed on the "Haptic Belt" method, and is higher mental demand than the "Base" method.

According to the Anova test at Table \ref{tab:anova_gsr} and the LSD test at \ref{tab:lsd_gsr} only the "Virtual Cane" and the "Mixture" method provoked a different reaction than the "Base" method, but since the Shapiro test at the Table \ref{tab:shapiro_gsr} showed that they are not normally distruted, than this conclusion has no foundation.
