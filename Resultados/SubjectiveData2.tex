\subsection{Subjective data}

Only two of the questionnaires will be analyzed, the NASA-TLX and the Adapted SAGAT, and it is expected that for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \nameref{subsubsec:results_nasa_tlx_2};
    
        There will be a noticeable difference between the sight sample mental workload and the blind sample mental workload.

    \item \nameref{subsubsec:results_adapted_sagat_2};
    
        Is expected to notice a difference between the “blind” sample and the “sight” sample.

    \item \nameref{subsubsec:results_questionnaires}.

        Meant to assess the user experience with each method.

\end{itemize}
