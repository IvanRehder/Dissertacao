\subsection{Physiological data}

The same sensors used for the first objective are used for the second objective. The expectations for all of the results is a difference between the “blind” sample and the “sight” sample. This subsection was divided in the same way as before:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \nameref{subsubsec:results_ecg_2};
    
        Two features are extracted from the ECG, heartrate (BPM) and heartrate variance (SDNN).
    
        Is expected that the heartrate increases at every “First” round and then a slight decrease in the next round. The heartrate variance is expected to decrease in the “First” round and a slight increase in the next round.    

    \item \nameref{subsubsec:results_gsr_temp_2};
    
        Is expected that the GSR average to increase at every “First” round and then a slight decrease in the next round.

\end{itemize}
