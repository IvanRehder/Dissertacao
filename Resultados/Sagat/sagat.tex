\subsection{Adapted SAGAT}
\label{subsec:results_adapted_sagat}

In this subsection the Sagat questionnaire is analyzed. Its result's may give an ideia of the mental map the participant is drawing. For each question a participant could score 1 point or a fraction of it. The total score of each participant is presented on the Table \ref{tab:sagat} and they are plotted in the Figures \ref{fig:barplot_sagat_scene_blind} and \ref{fig:barplot_sagat_scene_sight}. It visually noticible that both of the groups perform better in the second time they visit the room.

The Table \ref{tab:sagat_average} show the the average Sagat score between the rounds of each participant and the Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_sagat_scene} these data is plotted. It is possible only to assume that some methods causes differente Sagat scores than other, but both groups performed rather similarly.

The Table \ref{tab:sagat_average_group} show the the average Sagat score grouped by visual condition and these data, without considering the "Base" method, is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:barplot_sagat}. Both the table and the figure also show a slightly difference between the score in favor of the "blind" sample.

The Shapiroâ€“Wilk normality test on the Table \ref{tab:shapiro_sagat_score} shows that these data are normally distributed, with a p-value higher than 0.05, then it is possible to perform a T-Test to guarantee that the "blind" sample is different then the "sight" sample.

\input{Resultados/Sagat/Tabelas/shapiro_sagat_score}

Acording to the T-Test presented on the Table \ref{tab:ttest_sagat_score}, the only method that showed a difference on the Sagat score between the "sight" sample and the "blind" sample is the "Base" method. The other methods both samples had a similar Sagat score.

\input{Resultados/Sagat/Tabelas/ttest_sagat_score}

The Table \ref{tab:anova_sagat_avg} shows the Anova test p-value of the Sagat score average of the "blind" sample between the guidance methods presented on the Table \ref{tab:sagat_average}. The p-value indicates that there is at least one method that is statistically equal to one of the other methods.

\input{Resultados/Sagat/Tabelas/anova_sagat_avg.tex}

The Table \ref{tab:lsd_sagat_avg} presents the analysis of a pairwise Fisher LSD test of the blind average Sagat score  between all the guidance methods. The results show that only "Virtual Cane" caused a different average score than the one notice on the "Base" Method. The rest of the methods are did not signifcally chance it.

\input{Resultados/Sagat/Tabelas/lsd_sagat_avg.tex}

The Table \ref{tab:anova_sagat_var} shows the Anova test p-value of the Sagat score variation of the "blind" sample between the guidance methods presented on the Table \ref{tab:sagat_var}. The p-value indicates that there is at least one method that is statistically equal to one of the other methods so its recommended to do a pairwise analyses between all the methods.

\input{Resultados/Sagat/Tabelas/sagat_var.tex}

\input{Resultados/Sagat/Tabelas/anova_sagat_var.tex}

The Table \ref{tab:lsd_sagat_var} presents the conclusion of a pairwise Fisher LSD test of the blind Sagat score variation between all the guidance methods. The results show that the ""Haptic Belt" and the "Mixture" method have a different variation then the "Base" method and they are also different between each other. This can be seen at the Table \ref{tab:sagat_var_average_group} and in the Figure \ref{fig:barplot_sagat_var_scene_blind} compiles the Sagat score average of the methods observed on all of the participants.

According to T-Test on Table \ref{tab:ttest_sagat_score}, there is no differecen in Sagat score between the "sight" and the "blind" sample.

According to both Anova test at Table \ref{tab:anova_sagat_avg} and LSD test at Table \ref{tab:lsd_sagat_avg} only the "Virtual Cane" method has a different Sagat score average and according to the Anova test at Table \ref{tab:anova_sagat_var} and the LSD test at Table \ref{lsd_sagat_var} the "Virtual Cane" also has a different variation then the "Base" method, with the "Virtual Cane" having a higher, and positive, variation.


Finally, also according with Anova tes at Anova test at Table \ref{tab:anova_sagat_avg} and LSD test at Table \ref{tab:lsd_sagat_avg} the "Mixture" method also has a significant increase, different the the "Base" method. This increase is also bigger and higher.
