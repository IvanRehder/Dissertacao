There were 3 different sensors in this experiment, 2 that collected physiological data and the one left collected temperature. The last one was used only the eliminate an possible increase at the GSR sensor caused by the increase of the temperature. These were all used to assess Mental Workload.

At the beggining of each experience, a baseline data was gathered to establish a comparison. All the following analysis is made in relation with the relative baseline data.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \nameref{subsec:results_ecg};
    
        Is expected that the ECG frequency to increase at every "First" round and then a slight decrease in the next round. Also the variation is expected to decrease at the "First" round and a slight increase in the next round.

    \item \nameref{subsec:results_gsr_temp};
    
        Is expected that the GSR average to increase at every "First" round and then a slight decrease in the next round.

\end{itemize}
