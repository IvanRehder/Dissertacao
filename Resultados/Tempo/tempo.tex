The data collected from the participants are shown in the Table \ref{tab:duracao_average}.

\input{Resultados/Tempo/Tabelas/duracao_average}

The Table \ref{tab:duracao_min_average_group} show the average time in each method grouped by visual condition and they are plotted in the Figure \ref{fig:barplot_duration_scene_blind} and \ref{fig:barplot_duration_scene_sight}. The Figure \ref{fig:barplot_duration_scene_blind} shows that there is no pattern in time variation in the rounds. The Figure \ref{fig:barplot_duration_scene_sight} shows that there is an increase in the time in the "Return" round by every method, with the exception of the "Mixture" method.

In the Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_duration_scene} is plotted the time of each participant and it shows that there could be some difference in the time between the methods, but that would only be assured with a hypothesis test.

The Table \ref{tab:duracao_var_group} show the time variation in each method grouped by visual condition and Figure \ref{fig:barplot_duration_global} these data is plotted. The table shows a noticeable difference between the two groups. The Figure \ref{fig:barplot_duration_global} shows that the global average of the groups in all scenes were almost the same.

For more correct analysis, one should use statistical methods to analyze. So hypothesis tests were used, but the first step in this analysis is to check if the sample has a normal distribution. 

The Table \ref{tab:shapiro_duration} shows the Shapiro Wilk test p-value. If this value is higher than 0.05, then the sample is normally distributed. The table \ref{tab:shapiro_duration} indicates that the p-values of the time averages are normally distributed hence the steps that follow are allowed to be used.

%\input{Resultados/Tempo/Tabelas/shapiro_duration.tex}

The Table \ref{tab:ttest_duration} shows the T-test p-value between the time average of the blind sample and the time average of the sight sample. If this value is higher than 0.05, it means that there is no statistical differences between the samples and that both samples had the same time performance. The table \ref{tab:ttest_duration} indicates the time of both the blind and the sighted users are statistically the same.

The Table \ref{tab:blockedanova_duration_var} shows the Anova test p-value of the blind time averages between the guidance methods. If this value is higher than 0.05, there is at least one method that has no statistical difference between one from the other methods. The table \ref{tab:blockedanova_duration_var} indicates that at all of the time observations are different.

%The Table \ref{tab:lsd_duration} presents a pairwise Fisher LSD test of the blind time average between all the guidance methods. If the resulted p-value is higher than 0.05 then the pair is statistically the same. The Table \ref{tab:lsd_duration} shows the conclusion of each p-value, and that is that all the methods provoke a different time reaction than the time on the "Base" method, but there is no difference between them. only the "Virtual Cane" would be considered similar to the "Base" method, and looking at the Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_duration_scene} above one can see that both distributions are very similar. As for the other methods, the one that improved the time spent at each scene would be the "Mixture".

Considering the on Table \ref{tab:ttest_duration}, the duration of the "sight" sample is similar to the "blind" sample and considering the conclusion from the ANOVA test and the Tables \ref{tab:duracao_min_average_group} and \ref{tab:duracao_var_group}, the methods that had the best time efficiency was the "Mixture" and the "Virtual Cane", and the least one was the "Audio" method.

Despite all these results above, it is noticeable some outliers in the data, especially in the first participants, when the most minor procedure errors, such as the one to stop the simulation, hence stopping the timer, had happened.
