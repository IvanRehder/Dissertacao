%\begin{itemize}
%    \item The scene made with the white cane would be the fastest and with the less number of impacts; \\ 
%    Since the participant is already used with this method, it is safe to assume that with the others methods the participant would go slower and hit more furniture on the way.
%    \item Comparing both scenes made with the same method, the second one would have the fastest and with less impact; \\
%    Not only this is expected but also that is the intention on having two scenes with each method.

The data collected from the participants are show in the Table \ref{tab:duracao_average}.

\input{Resultados/Tempo/Tabelas/duracao_average}

The Table \ref{tab:duracao_average_scene} show the the average time of each participant on each method and they are plotted in the Figure \ref{fig:barplot_duration_scene_blind} and \ref{fig:barplot_duration_scene_sight}. The Figure show that there is no pattern in the relationship between the difference of the rounds of each method with the visual condition of the users.

The Table \ref{tab:duracao_var_group} show the the average time grouped by visual condition and Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_duration_scene} these data is plotted. The Figure show that there could be some difference in the time between the methods, but that would only be assured with a hypothesis test.

The Table \ref{tab:duracao_var_group} show the the average time grouped by visual condition and Figure \ref{fig:barplot_duration_global} these data is plotted. The table shows a noticible difference between the two groups. The Figure \ref{fig:barplot_duration_global} show that the global average of the groups in all scenes were almost the same.

For a more correct analysis, one should use statistical methods to analyse. So hypothesis tests were used, but the first step in this analysese is to check the if the sample has a normal distribuition. 

The Table \ref{tab:shapiro_duration} shows the Shapiro Wilk test p-value. If this value is higher than 0.05, then the sample is normally distributed. The table \ref{tab:shapiro_duration} indicates that the p-values of the time averages are normally distributed hence the steps that follow are allowed to be used.

\input{Resultados/Tempo/Tabelas/shapiro_duration.tex}

The Table \ref{tab:ttest_duration} shows the T test p-value between the time average of the blind sample and time average of the sight sample. If this value is higher than 0.05, it means that there are no statistically difference between the samples and that both samples had the same time performance. The table \ref{tab:ttest_duration} indicates the time of both the blind and the sight user are statistically the same, with an exception of the "Audio" method.

\input{Resultados/Tempo/Tabelas/ttest_duration.tex}

The Table \ref{tab:anova_duration_var} shows the Anova test p-value of the blind time averages between the guidance methods presented in tha Table \ref{tab:duracao_var}. If this value is higher than 0.05, there is at least one method that has no statistically difference between one of the other methods. The table \ref{tab:anova_duration_var} indicates that there are no similar variation between the methods, that means that all of the time differences noticed on the methods are relevant.

\input{Resultados/Tempo/Tabelas/duracao_var.tex}

\input{Resultados/Tempo/Tabelas/anova_duration_var.tex}

%The Table \ref{tab:lsd_duration_var} presents a pairwise Fisher LSD test of the blind time average between all the guidance methods. If the resulted p-value is higher than 0.05 then the pair is statistically the same. The Table \ref{tab:lsd_duration_var} shows the conclusion of each p-value, and that is that all the methods provoke a different time reaction than the time on the "Base" method, but there are no difference between them. only the "Virtual Cane" would be considered similar of the "Base" method, and looking at the Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_duration_scene} above one can see that both distributions are very similar. As for the other methods, the one that improved the time spended at each scene would be the "Mixture".

Considering the on Table \ref{tab:ttest_duration}, the duration of the "sight" sample is similar to the "blind" sample and considering the conclusion from the ANOVA test and the Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_duration_scene}, the method that had the better time efficiency was the one mixing all of the methods together, and the least one was the "Audio" method.

Despite all these results above, it is noticible some outliers in the data, specially in the first participants, when the most minor procedure errors, such as the one to stop the simulation, hence stoping the timer, had happened.

%The Shapiroâ€“Wilk normality test shows that these data are normally distributed, with a p-value higher than 0.05, then it is possible to perform a t-test to guarantee that the "blind" sample is different then the "sight" sample and that is verified by the t-test's p-value that is lesser than 0.05.
