\subsection{Electrocardiogram (ECG) data}
\label{subsec:results_ecg}

The ECG analysis is divided in two different types

\begin{itemize}
    \item Heart rate;
    
        This analysis checks the heart beat frequency;

    \item Heart rate variancy.
    
        This analysis checks the heart beat frequency variance and it is done by analysing variation of the interval between beats.

\end{itemize}

At the beggining of each experience, a baseline data was gathered to establish a comparison between the normal state of the user and the state induced state by the scene.

After the data gathering, an algorithm in python was used to read the data and separate accordingly to each participant, method and round. Since the participants moved during the whole experience a lot of noise was collected by the sensors, so these outlier where removed. The following steps was to normalize the data between -1 and 1 and then a peak detection method used and if the results were appropriate the interval between each peak were calculated and saved to be used in the next software. This judgment was made by analyzing the plotted ecg signal and the detected peaks. If the detected peaks are not aligned if the peaks of the signal, than the methods paramenter were tuned to fit the detected peaks with the signals' peaks.

The next used software was Kubios HRV Standard. Kubios is a heart rate variability (HRV) analysis software for personal non-commercial use. The Kubios HRV Standard makes it possible to use your HR monitor to examine the health of the cardiovascular system or to evaluate stress and recovery \cite{kubios}. At Kubius, the file with the saved intervals were analysed and the results saved in a report file to be read in python again. In python the the results were plotted, tabled and statiscally as the other data. At Appendix \ref{ap:ecg_processing_apend} there is a diagram with a pseudoalgorithm of this process.

This analyses was made comparing the baseline values wtih the values of each round individually and between the round values themselves.
