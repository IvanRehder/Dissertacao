\subsection{NASA-TLX}
\label{subsec:results_nasa_tlx}

It is possible to analyze the mental workload using NASA-TLX two different ways. The first is to by analyzing only the mental demand scale and the second is by analyzing the NASA-TLX score, which is a average of the scales' rating.

\subsubsection{Analysis of the mental demand scale}

The Table \ref{tab:md_table} presents the mental demand averages by each participant on each scenes and they are plotted in the Figures \ref{fig:barplot_md_scene_blind} and \ref{fig:barplot_md_scene_sight}.

    }
    \caption{Bar plot of the average mental demand of the sighted participants on each method.}
    \label{fig:barplot_md_scene_sight}
\end{figure}

The Table \ref{tab:md_average} show the the average mental demand between the rounds of each participant and the Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_md_scene} these data is plotted. The figure shows a noticible difference between the two groups.  The Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_md_scene} indicates a visual difference between the mental demmand feeled by the sighted participants and the mental demand feeled by the blind participants. Inside the blind participants groups is also noticible a difference between the methods, but the ones that are different does not show a better performance, instead a higher mental demand than the one feeled during the "Base" method.

    }
    \caption{Boxplot of the average mental demand of participant.}
    \label{fig:boxplot_md_scene}
\end{figure}

The Table \ref{tab:md_average_group} show the the average mental demand grouped by visual condition and these data is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:barplot_md_global}. Both the table and the figure also show the difference between the mental demand of the "sight" sample and the "blind" sample.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/md_average_group.tex}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \label{fig:barplot_md_global}
\end{figure}

The Shapiro–Wilk normality test on the Table \ref{tab:shapiro_mental_demand} shows that these data are normally distributed, with a p-value higher than 0.05, then it is possible to perform a T-Test to guarantee that the "blind" sample is different then the "sight" sample.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/shapiro_mental_demand}

Acording to the T-Test presented on the Table \ref{tab:ttest_mental_demand}, the only method that showed a difference on the mental demand between the "sight" sample and the "blind" sample is the audio method. The other methods both samples had a similar mental demand.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/ttest_mental_demand}

The Table \ref{tab:anova_mental_demand_avg} shows the Anova test p-value of the mental demand average of the "blind" sample between the guidance methods presented on the Table \ref{tab:md_average}. The p-value indicates that there is at least one method that is statistically equal to one of the other methods.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/anova_mental_demand_avg.tex}

The Table \ref{tab:lsd_mental_demand_avg} presents the conclusion of a pairwise Fisher LSD test of the blind mental demand average between all the guidance methods. The results show that only "Haptic Belt" caused a different mental demand average than the one notice on the "Base" Method.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/lsd_mental_demand_avg.tex}

The Table \ref{tab:anova_mental_demand_var} shows the Anova test p-value of the mental demand variation of the "blind" sample between the guidance methods presented on the Table \ref{tab:md_variation}. The p-value indicates that there is at least one method that is statistically equal to one of the other methods so its recommended to do a pairwise analyses between all the methods.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/md_variation.tex}

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/anova_mental_demand_var.tex}

The Table \ref{tab:lsd_mental_demand_var} presents the conclusion of a pairwise Fisher LSD test of the blind mental demand variation between all the guidance methods. The results show that the "Virtual Cane" method has a similar mental demand variation with the "Base" method. All other methods have a different variation. This can be seen at the Table \ref{tab:md_var_average_group} and in the Figure \ref{fig:barplot_md_var_scene_blind} compiles the mental demand average of the methods observed on all of the participants.

    \caption{Barplot of the average mental demand variation from the blind participants of each method.}
    \label{fig:barplot_md_var_scene_blind}
\end{figure}

According to T-Test on Table \ref{tab:ttest_mental_demand}, the mental demand of the "sight" sample is similar to the "blind" sample, excluding only on the "Audio" method.

According to both Anova test at Table \ref{tab:anova_mental_demand_avg} and \ref{tab:anova_mental_demand_var}, Tables \ref{tab:md_average} and \ref{tab:md_variation} and Figure \ref{fig:barplot_md_var_scene_blind}, none of the methods did provoke a higher mental demand variation than the one notice on the "Base" method on the participants and the only different mental demand average was noticed on the "Haptic Belt" method, and is higher mental demand than the "Base" method.

\subsubsection{Analysis of the NASA-TLX score}

The Table \ref{tab:nasa_table} presents the Nasa score averages by each participant on each scenes and they are plotted in the Figures \ref{fig:barplot_nasa_scene_blind} and \ref{fig:barplot_nasa_scene_sight}. It is notible that after each "First" round the Nasa score diminishes for both "sight" and "blind" participants.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/nasa_table}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \label{fig:barplot_nasa_scene_sight}
\end{figure}

The Table \ref{tab:nasa_average} show the the average Nasa score between the rounds of each participant and in the Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_nasa_scene} these data is plotted. The table and the figure also shows a noticible difference between the two groups, meaning that problably the Nasa score from the "sight" sample higher then the one of the "blind" sample.

    \label{fig:boxplot_nasa_scene}
\end{figure}

The Table \ref{tab:nasa_average_group} show the the average Nasa score grouped by visual condition and these data is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:barplot_nasa_global}. Both the table and the figure also show the difference between the mental demand of the "sight" sample and the "blind" sample.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/nasa_average_group.tex}

    \label{fig:barplot_nasa_global}
\end{figure}

The Shapiro–Wilk normality test on the Table \ref{tab:shapiro_nasa_score} shows that these data are normally distributed, with an exception of the "Audio" Nasa score. This means that the further analysis cannot be applied for this method.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/shapiro_nasa_score}

Acording to the T-Test presented on the Table \ref{tab:ttest_nasa_score} it cannot be verified that the average Nasa score are different between the "sight" and the "blind" samples.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/ttest_nasa_score}

The Table \ref{tab:anova_nasa_avg} shows the Anova test p-value of the average Nasa score, presented on the Table \ref{tab:nasa_average}, of the "blind" sample between the guidance methods. The p-value indicates that there is at least one method that is statistically equal to one of the other methods so its recommended to do a pairwise analyses between all the methods.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/anova_nasa_avg}

The Table \ref{tab:lsd_mental_demand_var} presents the results of a pairwise Fisher LSD test of the blind Nasa score average between all the guidance methods. The results show that all of the averages are statistically the same. That means that there are no difference on the Nasa score feelt by the "blind" sample between the methods.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/lsd_nasa_avg}

The Table \ref{tab:anova_nasa_var} shows the Anova test p-value of the mental demand average of the "blind" sample between the guidance methods presented on the Table \ref{tab:nasa_var}. The p-value indicates that there is at least one method that is statistically equal to one of the other methods.

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/anova_nasa_var}

\input{Resultados/Nasa/Tabelas/nasa_var}

The Table \ref{tab:lsd_nasa_var} presents the conclusion of a pairwise Fisher LSD test of the blind Nasa score variation between all the guidance methods. The results show that only "Audio" method caused a different variation than the one notice on the "Base" Method. The Figure \ref{fig:barplot_nasa_var_scene_blind} shows the variation of the Nasa score and one can notice that the variation provoked on the "Audio" method" is a lot lesser than the other ones.

    \caption{Barplot of the Nasa score variation from the blind participants of each method.}
    \label{fig:barplot_nasa_var_scene_blind}
\end{figure}

According to T-Test on Table \ref{tab:ttest_nasa_score} all of the Nasa score are similar between the both groups.

According to both Anova test at Table \ref{tab:anova_nasa_avg} and \ref{tab:anova_nasa_avg}, Table \ref{tab:nasa_var} \ref{tab:nasa_average} and Figure \ref{fig:barplot_nasa_var_scene_blind}, all of the methods have a similar Nasa score average, and the only different variation is provoked by the "Audio" method, and is a smaller variation.
