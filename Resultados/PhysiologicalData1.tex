\subsection{Physiological data}

During the experiment, data from two physiological sensors were captured: ECG and GSR. As commonly found in the literature, these data are used to assess mental workload. The corresponding analysis is presented in this section.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \nameref{subsubsec:results_ecg_1};
    
        Two features are extracted from the ECG, heartrate (BPM) and heartrate variance (SDNN).
    
        Is expected that the heartrate slight decrease from the "First" to the "Return" round. The heartrate variance is expected to slight increase from the "First" to the "Return" round.
    

    \item \nameref{subsubsec:results_gsr_temp_1};
    
        Is expected that the GSR average to increase at every “First” round and then a slight decrease in the next round.
