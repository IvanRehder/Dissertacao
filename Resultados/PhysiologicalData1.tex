\subsection{Physiological data}

There were 3 different sensors in this experiment, 2 that collected physiological data and the one left collected temperature. The last one was used to eliminate the temperature influence on the GSR sensor. These were all used to assess Mental Workload.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \nameref{subsec:results_ecg};
    
        Two features are extracted from the ECG, heartrate (BPM) and heartrate variance (SDNN).
    
        Is expected that the heartrate slight decrease from the "First" to the "Return" round. The heartrate variance is expected to slight increase from the "First" to the "Return" round.
    

    \item \nameref{subsec:results_gsr_temp};
    
        Is expected that the GSR average to increase at every “First” round and then a slight decrease in the next round.

\end{itemize}
