There were 3 different questionnaires in this experiment. Each of these questionnaires were meant to verify one of the experiment goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \nameref{subsec:results_nasa_tlx};
    
        Meant to verify the mental workload of the user. Is expected that after each "First" round, the mental workload would decrease and that one of the methods would have the least mental workload. Also that there is a noticible difference between the sight sample mental workload and the blind sample mental workload.

    \item \nameref{subsec:results_adapted_sagat};
    
        Meant to verify the situation awareness and the mental map of the user. Is expected to notice an increase from the "First" round to the "Return" round at each method and a difference between the "blind" sample and the "sight" sample.

    \item \nameref{subsec:results_questionnaires}.

        Meant to assess the user experience with each method.

\end{itemize}
