\citeonline{kirner2011using} raised two questions, "How can blind people learn 3D concepts aiming to be able to convert explored 3D environments into pictures?" and "How can we develop a spatial audio tutor with augmented reality technology to make easy the understanding of 3D concepts by blind people?" and used not using virtual reality technology but augmented reality to answer them. They developed a augmented reality application to be a tutor for BVI users. The application used allowed BVI users to play audio streams that were associeated with spatial positions.

The application had 4 different environments and they for played in sequence to teach BVI users the idea of perspective in images and each environment had .

To test the application, ten congenitally people have used it, making comments about the learning of perspective concepts.
