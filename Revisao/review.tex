\section{Final Remarks}
\label{sec:final_remarks3}

This chapter discussed published works that are related to this dissertation. These works combine at least two of the following concepts: ”human factors”, ”virtual reality” and ”blindness”. 

Some of the works discuss the design of navigation tools, investigating different aspects of their solutions, while others focus on providing a virtual reality experiment to BVI users. Among the assessment techniques used in the literature, the NASA-TLX is a recurrent option, as well as the proposal of performance metrics.

Generally, all the surveyed works bring exciting conclusions about the designing of BVI devices and contributed in some way to the proposal of next chapter.
