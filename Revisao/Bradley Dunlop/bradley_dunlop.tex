Bradley and Dunlop written two works about BVI navigation, one in \citeyear{bradley2002investigating} and the last in \citeyear{bradley2005experimental}. 

\subsection{The 2002 investigation}

On 2002 they studied which information BVI users used throughout their navigation and compared the data collected with another similar data, but instead it was answered by sighted users. This second data was also collected by the same researchers in a prior investigation, made also in 2002, and both of the data were collected using the same interview's structure.

This investigation was made by analysing the answers from a interview with the participants. In this interview, the participants had to explain how to arrive to two different location as if they were talking to someone with the same condition. The answer were than classified in 11 different categories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Directional (e.g. left/right, north/south)
    \item Structural (e.g. road, monument, church)
    \item Environmental (e.g. hill, river, tree)
    \item Textual-structural (e.g. name of shops, places, restaurants)
    \item Textual-area/street based (e.g. name of street, neighborhoods, squares)
    \item Numerical (e.g. first, second, 100m)
    \item Descriptive (e.g. steep, tall)
    \item Temporal/Distance based (e.g. \textit{"walk until you reach..."} or \textit{"before you get to"})
    \item Sensory (e.g. sound of engines, smell of bread from a bakery)
    \item Motion (e.g. cars passing by, doors opening)
    \item Social Contact (e.g. asking people or using a guide dog for help)
\end{itemize}

The motion and the social contact was added in the interview with the BVI users, so the researches re-analysed the sighted answers to fill this classification as well. The Figures \ref{fig:bradley_2002} and \ref{fig:bradley_2002_2} show their findings.

In conclusion the researches realised that BVI participants use less text-based information than the sighted participants, but BVI participants used more words to describe a path than the sighted participants.

Besides describing the paths to reach the destinations, the researches also asked the BVI participants their "opinions on the importance of different types of contextual information for route navigation, design issues relating to usability and their mobile needs/requirements" \cite{bradley2002investigating}. Many participants said that white canes and guide dogs had limitations and also commented that sensory information are very important when different types were used together in order to confirm one information. 

\subsection{The 2005 experiment}

Based on the findings from 2002, Bradley and Dunlop designed an experiment to investigate if there is a difference between the perceived workload of both BVI participant and sighted participants when then navigate using a user-tailored information created with the results of both previous experiments.

16 participants, 8 sighted and 8 BVI, were recruited to walk to four pre-determined landmarks at the centre of Glasgow. They followed the same orientations that were pre-recorded and given to the participants. For each participant, orientations for 2 of these 4 landmarks, that were made using based on the proportions of the results of the sighted users' interview, were randomly given. Similar was made with the remaining 2 landmarks, but with orientations made with the findings of the BVI users' interview. These proportions are presented at the Table \ref{tab:bradley_2005_table}

Their results found out that BVI users reached landmarks significantly quicker when given the information that were made for that group, but still longer than sighted users. This comparison is show in the Figure \ref{fig:bradley_2005} and \ref{fig:bradley_2005_2}. Condition 1 is the verbal orientation made for sighted users and condition 2 is the verbal orientation made for BVI users

After the experiment a NASA-TLX was completed by each participant. The score for each dimensions is show in the Figures \ref{fig:bradley_2005_condition} and \ref{fig:bradley_2005_participants}. These scores show that BVI participants did had higher workload when guided by the condition 1 as well as the sighted participants did with the condition 2.

This current experiment used their conclusion in order to create proper navigation commands used in the experiment. Another difference between this experiment and the one written by the duo is the inclusion haptics information in the scope of studied guidance commands.
