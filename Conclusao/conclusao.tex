This work proposes using virtual reality to create an environment where concepts of assistive devices could be evaluated at the early stages of development by blind and visual impaired (BVI) people.

In order to systematize this proposal, this work presents a method composed of five phases that guide the development of the virtual environment in parallel with the design of the assistive devices and the proposal of assessment methods.

In order to illustrate the proposed method and investigate two research questions related to this work, it is described an application of the method for the evaluation of four different solutions of assistive devices in the environment of a hospital reception. For this example, it proposes as an assessment method the use of subjective questionnaires and physiological sensors. 

In order to evaluate situation awareness, this work proposes an adapted version of the SAGAT (Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique) questionnaire, which was initially introduced for evaluating the situation awareness of air traffic controllers. 

Based on the results from the hospital reception example, the two research questions are discussed.

%    \item Do BVI users feel present in the VE as if they were in the real world? \label{itm:obj_first}
%    \item BVI users rely on audio cues and haptic feedback to guide. But does it rely more on your type of information than the other? \label{itm:obj_second}
%    \item Do non-BVI users have the same demands and skills as BVI users when designing assistive products? \label{itm:obj_third}

\subsection*{Is it possible to evaluate and compare concepts of assistive devices from a human factors’ perspective in a virtual environment? What are the main limitations of the use of a virtual reality environment?
}

The example presented in this work showed that it is possible to evaluate both situation awareness and workload using experiments performed in a virtual environment. The tests performed in the virtual environment made possible the comparison of the assistive devices both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, some limitations were identified during the development of this work, regarding both the virtual environment and the assessment techniques.

One of the most recurrent observations was the unsatisfactory quality of the sound system. According to blind participants, the headphone of the VIVE HMD does not provide sounds with a quality good enough for them to locate the source of a sound. A regular comment was, “I feel like the sound origin is inside my head”. This limitation may be solved by placing a sound source in the real environment and use the HMD only for localizing the participant in the virtual environment.

Another limitation is the actual position of the furniture. After a first round, the furniture was not precisely aligned with its virtual model. A future solution for this problem would be to use a locator on each piece of furniture.

Among the main limitations identified during this work, it is worth mentioning the failure to detect collisions in the virtual environment, which could be solved by integrating sensors that monitor the position of each arm and leg of the user.

Regarding the assessment methods for evaluating human factors, the physiological sensors did not show any systematic difference among the methods under analysis. This result may be due the noise in the sensors' data, compromising its quality. Another problem is that the low number of participants may compromise the statistical analysis, due to the large variability among users.

\subsection*{Do non-BVI users, when deprived of their vision, similarly evaluate assistive devices as BVI users?}

Comparing the results of the experiments performed with blind and sighted participants, some differences were observed. Among the most important, is the relative evaluation of audio and haptic devices. Due to their enhanced sensitivity to sounds, BVI users tend to evaluate audio solutions better than non-BVI. Also, the effect of repeating a task in the same environment, i.e., performing different rounds of the same experiment, may differ between sighted and blind users.

Generally, the results reinforce the importance of having BVI users involved in the design of assistive devices from the early stages of the specification of requirements. Maybe the differences between the two groups would have been lesser if the non-BVI users were trained to navigate without sighte before the experiment.

\section{Future works and suggestions}

The following topics are of interest for future research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Perform a comparison between an evaluation campaign executed in a real environment and the same campaign executed in a virtual environment, to assess the main differences brought by the use of virtual reality;
    \item Further improve the virtual reality environment by providing better sound solutions, using different sources of sound in the real environment instead of using the sound from the HMD;
    \item Develop a solution for automatic collision detection in the virtual system to introduce performance metrics in the assessment.
    \item Repeat the experimental campaign with large sample of both BVI and non-BVI users, in order to improve the statistical analysis.
    \item Investigate the sources of noise of the physiological sensors and improve their data acquisition.
\end{itemize}
