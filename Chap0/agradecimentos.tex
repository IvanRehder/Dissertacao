%% Agradecimentos

I would like to thank my advisor Profª Emilia Vilani and co-advisor Dr. Edmar Thomaz da Silva for their guidance and trust throughout this project.

To thank my parents, for all of the support that was given to me all of these years and that I will always be thankful for having.

To thank Sidney, that guided me in this universe of blind and visually impaired users. Without him, the devices and the results would be very different, and probably less efficient, than the final ones.

To thank Gabriel "Boi", Santiago, André, Wellington and every one of the Competence Center in Manufacturing (and all my other friends that I could not mention here) that shared experiences and knowledge of the daily life of a master's student and also helped me on some of the solutions used in the work.

To thank all of the participants that gave a little bit of their time and patience to provide me with data for this work.
